 Here's a step-by-step guide to create a SWRL rule from a rule in natural language:

    Step 1: Identify the Entities and Relationships (nouns, verbs, and adjectives)
    Step 2: Translate to SWRL
    Step 3: Define Conditions and Conclusions
    Step 4: Map to SWRL
    Step 5: Generate the SWRL rule


Example 
Rule in natural language: If a person has a sibling who is a man, then the person has a brother.

Step 1: 
  Conditions: person has a sibling who is a man
  Conclusions: the person has a brother
Step 2: 
  Entities: person, sibling, man, brother
  Relationships: has sibling, is man, has brother
Step 3: Person(?p), hasSibling(?p, ?s), Person(?s), IsMan(?s, true), hasBrother(?p, ?s)
Step 4: 
  Conditions: Person(?p) ^ hasSibling(?p, ?s) ^ Person(?s) ^ IsMan(?s)
  Conclusions: hasBrother(?p, ?s)
Step 5: Person(?p) ^ hasSibling(?p, ?s) ^ Person(?s) ^ IsMan(?s) -> hasBrother(?p, ?s)
SWRL rule: Person(?p) ^ hasSibling(?p, ?s) ^ Person(?s) ^ IsMan(?s) -> hasBrother(?p, ?s)


Example 
Rule in natural language: If a person has a phone number that starts with '+', then the person has an international phone number.

Step 1: 
  Conditions: person has a phone number that starts with '+'
  Conclusions: the person has an international phone number
Step 2: 
  Entities: person, phone number, international phone number
  Relationships: has phone number, starts with, has international phone number
Step 3: Person(?p), PhoneNumber(?number), hasPhoneNumber(?p, ?number), swrlb:startsWith(?number, "+"), hasInternationalPhoneNumber(?p, true)
Step 4: 
  Conditions: Person(?p) ^ PhoneNumber(?number) ^ hasPhoneNumber(?p, ?number) ^ swrlb:startsWith(?number, "+")
  Conclusions: hasInternationalPhoneNumber(?p, true)
Step 5: Person(?p) ^ PhoneNumber(?number) ^ hasPhoneNumber(?p, ?number) ^ swrlb:startsWith(?number, "+") -> hasInternationalPhoneNumber(?p, true)
SWRL rule: Person(?p) ^ PhoneNumber(?number) ^ hasPhoneNumber(?p, ?number) ^ swrlb:startsWith(?number, "+") -> hasInternationalPhoneNumber(?p, true)


Example
Rule in natural language:  If a person has an age greater than 17, then the person is an adult.

Step 1: 
  Conditions: person has an age greater than 17
  Conclusions: the person is an adult
Step 2: 
  Entities: person, age, adult
  Relationships: has age, greater than
Step 3: Person(?p), hasAge(?p, ?age), Age(?age), swrlb:greaterThan(?age, 17), Adult(?p)
Step 4: 
  Conditions: Person(?p) ^ hasAge(?p, ?age) ^ Age(?age) ^ swrlb:greaterThan(?age, 17)
  Conclusions: Adult(?p)
Step 5: Person(?p) ^ hasAge(?p, ?age) ^ Age(?age) ^ swrlb:greaterThan(?age, 17) -> Adult(?p)
SWRL rule: Person(?p) ^ hasAge(?p, ?age) ^ Age(?age) ^ swrlb:greaterThan(?age, 17) -> Adult(?p)


Example
Rule in natural language:  If a publication has two different authors, then those authors have cooperated with each other.

Step 1: 
  Conditions: a publication has two different authors
  Conclusions: those authors have cooperated with each other
Step 2: 
  Entities: publication, author
  Relationships: has author, different, cooperated with
Step 3: Publication(?p), Author(?y), Author(?z), hasAuthor(?p, ?y), hasAuthor(?p, ?z), differentFrom(?y, ?z), cooperatedWith(?y, ?z)
Step 4: 
  Conditions: Publication(?p) ^ Author(?y) ^ Author(?z) ^ hasAuthor(?p, ?y) ^ hasAuthor(?p, ?z) ^ differentFrom(?y, ?z)
  Conclusions: cooperatedWith(?y, ?z)
Step 5: 
Publication(?p) ^ Author(?y) ^ Author(?z) ^ hasAuthor(?p, ?y) ^ hasAuthor(?p, ?z) ^ differentFrom(?y, ?z) -> cooperatedWith(?y, ?z)
SWRL rule: Publication(?p) ^ Author(?y) ^ Author(?z) ^ hasAuthor(?p, ?y) ^ hasAuthor(?p, ?z) ^ differentFrom(?y, ?z) -> cooperatedWith(?y, ?z)


Example
Rule in natural language:  If a driver has an age greater than 25, then the driver is insurable 

Step 1: 
  Conditions: a driver has an age greater than 25
  Conclusions: the driver is insurable
Step 2: 
  Entities: driver, age
  Relationships: has age, greater than, is insurable
Step 3: Driver(?d), hasAge(?d, ?age), Age(?age), swrlb:greaterThan(?age, 25), isInsurable(?d, true)
Step 4: 
  Conditions: Driver(?d) ^ hasAge(?d, ?age) ^ Age(?age) ^ swrlb:greaterThan(?age, 25)
  Conclusions: isInsurable(?d, true)
Step 5: Driver(?d) ^ hasAge(?d, ?age) ^ Age(?age) ^ swrlb:greaterThan(?age, 25) -> isInsurable(?d, true)
SWRL rule: Driver(?d) ^ hasAge(?d, ?age) ^ Age(?age) ^ swrlb:greaterThan(?age, 25) -> isInsurable(?d, true)


Example
