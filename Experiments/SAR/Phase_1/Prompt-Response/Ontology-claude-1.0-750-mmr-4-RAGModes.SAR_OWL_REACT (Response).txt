I'll simulate a conversation between the three roles to create a SAR ontology for wildfire incidents.

Knowledge Engineer (KE): Hello! Let's start creating our SAR ontology. Based on the requirements, we need to focus on wildfires, environmental data, and mission coordination. Domain Expert, could you help us understand the key concepts we should model?

Domain Expert (DE): Yes. From my experience in SAR operations during wildfires, we need to model several critical aspects:
1. The incident itself - location, type, severity
2. Environmental conditions - especially weather factors like wind, temperature, humidity
3. Resources and response units
4. Impact assessment - affected areas, damages
5. Mission planning and coordination

Knowledge Worker (KW): As a user, I need the ontology to help me answer questions about current incidents, resource allocation, and mission priorities. The social media and sensor data integration is crucial for real-time situational awareness.

KE: Let me start drafting the core classes based on this input. Here's an initial structure in Turtle:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/sar#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:Incident rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "Represents emergency incidents"@en .

:WildfireIncident rdfs:subClassOf :Incident .

:WeatherCondition rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "Weather conditions affecting the incident"@en .

:Mission rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "SAR mission details and planning"@en .

:Resource rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "Resources available for SAR operations"@en .
```

DE: That's a good start, but we need to add more specific classes for weather conditions and impact assessment. Also, from the domain data, I notice we need classes for affected areas and causes of fire.

KW: Yes, and we need properties to link these classes and represent relationships between missions and resources.

Let's continue building this iteratively. Would you like me to proceed with the next part of the ontology development?
