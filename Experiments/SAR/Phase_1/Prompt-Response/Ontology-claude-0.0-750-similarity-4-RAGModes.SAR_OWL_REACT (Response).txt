I'll simulate a conversation between the three roles to create the SAR ontology for wildfire incidents. Let's begin:

Knowledge Engineer (KE): Hello! I'm the knowledge engineer responsible for creating the SAR ontology. Let's start by discussing the key requirements and scope.

Domain Expert (DE): Hello! As a domain expert in SAR operations and wildfire management, I can provide detailed domain knowledge. From the requirements, we need to focus on four main aspects: incidents/impacts, weather conditions, observation data, and mission coordination.

Knowledge Worker (KW): Hi! As someone who will use this ontology, I need it to effectively support decision-making during wildfire incidents. The competency questions suggest we need detailed information about weather, incidents, observations, and mission coordination.

KE: Let's start with the core concepts. DE, what are the primary entities we should model for wildfire incidents?

DE: We should model:
1. Wildfire incidents and their characteristics
2. Weather conditions that affect fires
3. Different types of impacts (on land, buildings, people)
4. Mission resources and coordination
5. Observation sources (sensors, social media, first responders)

KW: From my perspective, we also need to track:
- Priority levels of incidents
- Real-time sensor data
- Population density in affected areas
- Mission status and urgency

KE: I'll start creating the ontology structure. Here's the initial version in Turtle format:
