### Iterative Discussion

#### Knowledge Engineer (KE), Domain Expert (DE), and Knowledge Worker (KW) Discussion

**KE:** Let's start by identifying the main concepts and relationships we need for our ontology. We need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. 

**DE:** For incidents and impacts, we need to capture the types of incidents, their locations, and their priorities. We also need to include the impacts on various entities like forests, buildings, and people.

**KW:** Don't forget to include the weather conditions that can influence the wildfire, such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity. We also need to capture the current measurements and forecasts.

**KE:** Good point. We also need to include data from sensors, satellites, and social media. This will help us monitor and assess the wildfire situation in real-time.

**DE:** For missions and relationships between services, we need to represent the different types of missions, the services involved, and their locations. We also need to capture the urgency and priority of these missions.

**KW:** Let's not forget to include the population density and the location of people involved in the incident. This is crucial for effective decision-making.

**KE:** Agreed. Let's start by defining the main classes and properties. We can refine and extend them as we go along.

### Initial Ontology Design

### Iterative Refinement

**KE:** Let's refine the `Incident` class. We need to capture the type of incident, its location, and its priority.

**DE:** We should also include the impacts on various entities like forests, buildings, and people.

**KW:** And don't forget to capture the urgency of the incident.

**KE:** Agreed. Let's add these properties to the `Incident` class.

**KE:** Now, let's refine the `WeatherCondition` class. We need to capture temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather forecasts.

**DE:** We should also include the current measurements for these weather variables.

**KW:** And the forecast for the weather in the specific location.

**KE:** Good points. Let's add these properties to the `WeatherCondition` class.

**KE:** Next, let's refine the `SensorData`, `SatelliteData`, and `SocialMediaData` classes. We need to capture the data from these sources, their creation dates, and their locations.

**DE:** We should also include the classification type of smoke and the status of wildfire forestry works.

**KW:** And the vulnerable objects involved in the incident.

**KE:** Agreed. Let's add these properties to the respective classes.

**KE:** Finally, let's refine the `Mission` and `Service` classes. We need to capture the types of missions, the services involved, and their locations.

**DE:** We should also include the urgency and priority of these missions.

**KW:** And the population density in the area and the location of the involved people.

**KE:** Good points. Let's add these properties to the respective classes.
