### Iterative Discussion

#### Knowledge Engineer (KE): 
Alright team, we need to create an ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions focused on wildfire incidents. Let's start by defining the key concepts and structure of the ontology. We'll need to address incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and services.

#### Domain Expert (DE): 
Absolutely. For incidents and impacts, we need to include concepts like "WildfireIncident", "Impact", "Location", and "Priority". For weather conditions, we'll need "Temperature", "WindSpeed", "Humidity", and "WeatherForecast".

#### Knowledge Worker (KW): 
Don't forget about the data from sensors and social media. We'll need concepts like "SensorData", "SatelliteData", "SocialMediaData", and "FirstResponderInput". Also, for missions and services, we'll need "Mission", "Service", "Support", and "PopulationDensity".

#### KE: 
Great. Let's start by defining the core classes and properties. We'll use OWL axioms to make the ontology expressive. For example, "WildfireIncident" will be a subclass of "Incident", and we'll define properties like "hasImpact", "hasLocation", and "hasPriority".

#### DE: 
For weather conditions, we can define "WeatherCondition" as a class with properties like "hasTemperature", "hasWindSpeed", "hasHumidity", and "hasWeatherForecast". Each of these can be datatype properties with appropriate ranges.

#### KW: 
For data from human and earth observations, we'll need properties like "hasSource", "hasCreationDate", "hasLocation", and "hasClassificationType". These will help us link the data to specific observations and incidents.

#### KE: 
Let's also define the relationships between missions and services. We can have properties like "offersService", "followsMission", "hasMissionLocation", "hasUrgentMissionLocation", "hasPopulationDensity", and "hasInvolvedPeople".

#### DE: 
Don't forget to include the specific details from the domain data provided. Concepts like "FireForm", "NotificationMethod", "HazardIndex", and "Responsibility" should be included as well.

#### KW: 
We should also make sure the ontology can answer the competency questions provided. For example, CQ1 and CQ2 can be addressed by the "WeatherCondition" class and its properties. CQ4 and CQ5 can be addressed by the "WildfireIncident" class and its properties.

#### KE: 
Alright, let's integrate these concepts and properties into the ontology and ensure it can answer all the competency questions.
