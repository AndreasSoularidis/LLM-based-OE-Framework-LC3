### Iterative Discussion

#### Round 1

**Knowledge Engineer (KE):**
Alright, team. Let's start by defining the core concepts and relationships for our ontology. We need to cover incidents, impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services.

**Domain Expert (DE):**
For incidents and impacts, we should include concepts like Wildfire, Incident, Impact, and Priority. We also need to capture weather conditions such as Temperature, WindSpeed, Humidity, and WeatherForecast.

**Knowledge Worker (KW):**
Don't forget about the data sources. We need to include concepts for Sensors, Satellites, SocialMedia, and FirstResponders. Also, we need to define relationships between these data sources and the incidents.

**KE:**
Good point. Let's also define the missions and services involved in wildfire management. We'll need concepts like Mission, Service, Firefighting, and CrisisManagementCentre.

#### Round 2

**KE:**
I've created the initial set of classes and properties. Let's review them and see if we need to add more details.

**DE:**
We need to include specific properties for weather conditions like hasTemperature, hasWindSpeed, and hasHumidity. Also, let's add properties to link incidents to their locations and priorities.

**KW:**
We should also add properties to capture data from different sources, such as hasSensorData, hasSocialMediaData, and hasSatelliteData.

**KE:**
Agreed. I'll incorporate these properties and also add some axioms to make the ontology more expressive.

#### Round 3

**KE:**
I've added the properties and some axioms. Let's see if we can answer the competency questions now.

**DE:**
For CQ1, we need to ensure that the ontology can represent important weather variables like Temperature, WindSpeed, and Humidity.

**KW:**
For CQ2 and CQ3, we need to capture current measurements and forecasts for these weather variables.

**KE:**
I've added the necessary properties for these questions. Now, let's focus on the incidents and their priorities for CQ4, CQ5, and CQ6.

#### Round 4

**KE:**
I've added properties to link incidents to their locations and priorities. Let's see if we can answer CQ7 to CQ12 now.

**DE:**
We need to ensure that the ontology can represent data from different sources and their creation dates, locations, and classifications.

**KW:**
We should also include properties to capture the status of wildfire forestry works and vulnerable objects involved in incidents.

**KE:**
I've added these properties. Now, let's focus on the missions and relationships between services for CQ13 to CQ18.

#### Round 5

**KE:**
I've added properties to capture the services and missions involved in wildfire management. Let's review the ontology and see if it covers all the requirements and answers all the competency questions.

**DE:**
It looks comprehensive. We have covered incidents, weather conditions, data sources, and missions. Let's finalize it.

**KW:**
Agreed. The ontology seems to cover all the necessary aspects.

**KE:**
Great! Here's the final ontology in Turtle format.
