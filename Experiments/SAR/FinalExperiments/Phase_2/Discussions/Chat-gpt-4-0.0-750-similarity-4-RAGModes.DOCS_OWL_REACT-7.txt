Example 1: Knowledge Engineer Role

Question: How can we represent the concept of a wildfire incident in the ontology?
Thought: We need to create a class for 'Wildfire Incident' and define its properties.
Action: Create a class 'Wildfire Incident' and define properties such as 'location', 'severity', 'cause', 'impact', etc.
Observation: The 'Wildfire Incident' class is now defined with its properties.

Example 2: Domain Expert Role

Question: What are the key factors that influence the spread of a wildfire?
Thought: Weather conditions, vegetation type, and topography are key factors.
Action: Suggest to include classes for 'Weather Conditions', 'Vegetation Type', and 'Topography' in the ontology.
Observation: The ontology now includes classes for key factors influencing wildfire spread.

Example 3: Knowledge Worker Role

Question: How can we represent the concept of a SAR mission in the ontology?
Thought: We need to create a class for 'SAR Mission' and define its properties.
Action: Create a class 'SAR Mission' and define properties such as 'location', 'resources', 'personnel', 'objectives', etc.
Observation: The 'SAR Mission' class is now defined with its properties.
