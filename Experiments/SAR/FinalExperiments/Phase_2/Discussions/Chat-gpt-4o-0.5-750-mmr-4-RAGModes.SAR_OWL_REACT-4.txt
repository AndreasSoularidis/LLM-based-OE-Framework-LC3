### Iterative Discussion

**Knowledge Engineer (KE):** Alright team, we have a comprehensive task ahead of us. We need to create an ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions focused on wildfire incidents. Let's start by identifying the main concepts and relationships we need to cover.

**Domain Expert (DE):** Absolutely. We need to capture incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and details about missions and the relationships between services. We also have to answer the competency questions provided.

**Knowledge Worker (KW):** I agree. Let's break it down. For incidents and impacts, we need to identify key weather variables, the current measurements, the location of the incident, and the priority and urgency of incidents.

**KE:** Good point. We also need to include weather conditions like temperature, wind speed, humidity, and forecasts. For data from human and earth observations, we need to capture data from sensors, satellites, and social media, including the creation date and location of data, the classification type of smoke, and the status of forestry works.

**DE:** Don't forget about missions and relationships. We need to represent services offered for firefighting, the missions followed for these services, the location of these missions, the urgency, population density, and the location of involved people.

**KW:** Let's start by creating the main classes and properties. We should have classes like `Incident`, `WeatherCondition`, `ObservationData`, `Mission`, `Service`, `Location`, `Person`, `Animal`, `Building`, `Vehicle`, `Tool`, and `Equipment`.

**KE:** Agreed. We also need properties to connect these classes. For example, `hasWeatherCondition`, `hasObservationData`, `hasMission`, `hasService`, `hasLocation`, `hasPriority`, `hasUrgency`, `hasPopulationDensity`, `hasInvolvedPeople`, `hasClassificationType`, and `hasStatus`.

**DE:** Let's also import relevant existing ontologies to avoid duplicating knowledge. We can use ontologies related to weather, geographic locations, and emergency management.

**KW:** Great. Let's start defining the classes and properties in Turtle format.

**KE:** We've created the main classes and properties. Now let's ensure our ontology can answer the competency questions.

**DE:** For CQ1, CQ2, and CQ3, we need to represent weather variables like temperature, wind speed, and humidity. We have `hasTemperature`, `hasWindSpeed`, and `hasHumidity` properties.

**KW:** For CQ4 and CQ5, we need to capture the location and priority of incidents. We have `hasLocation` and `hasPriority` properties.

**KE:** For CQ6, we need to identify urgent incidents. We can use the `hasUrgency` property for that.

**DE:** For CQ7 to CQ12, we need to capture data from human and earth observations. We have `hasObservationData`, `hasCreationDate`, `hasClassificationType`, and `hasStatus` properties.

**KW:** Finally, for CQ13 to CQ18, we need to represent missions and relationships between services. We have `hasMission`, `hasService`, `hasLocation`, `hasPopulationDensity`, and `hasInvolvedPeople` properties.

**KE:** Excellent. Our ontology should now be able to answer all the competency questions and cover all the requirements. Let's finalize it.

**DE:** Agreed. This ontology should provide a comprehensive framework for SAR missions focused on wildfire incidents.

**KW:** Great work, team. Let's make sure the ontology is well-documented and shared with the relevant stakeholders.
