**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need to model for the Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in the context of wildfire incidents. We need to ensure our ontology can answer all the competency questions and cover the requirements.

**Domain Expert:** Absolutely. We need to include concepts like "Incident," "WeatherCondition," "SensorData," "Mission," and "Service." For incidents, we should capture details like location, priority, and urgency. Weather conditions should include variables like temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. We also need to consider the data sources, such as sensors and social media, and how they contribute to understanding the situation. The ontology should also represent the relationships between different services involved in wildfire management.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good points. Let's start by defining the main classes and properties. We can use existing ontologies where applicable to ensure interoperability. I'll begin by creating the basic structure.

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget to include subclasses for different types of incidents and weather conditions. We should also define properties to capture the relationships between these concepts.

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also consider how to represent the status of forestry works and the classification of smoke. These are important for assessing the situation on the ground.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. I'll incorporate these elements into the ontology. Let's iterate on this and refine as needed.

**Knowledge Engineer:** This initial version of the ontology captures the main concepts and relationships. Let's review it to ensure it answers all the competency questions and meets the requirements.

**Domain Expert:** It looks comprehensive. We should test it against the competency questions to verify its completeness.

**Knowledge Worker:** Agreed. Let's iterate on this and refine as needed to ensure it covers all aspects of SAR missions in wildfire incidents.
