**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need for our ontology. We need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. 

**Domain Expert:** For incidents and impacts, we should include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," "Location," and "Priority." These will help us answer questions like CQ4 and CQ5.

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. We also need to consider the weather conditions. Concepts like "WeatherCondition," "Temperature," "WindSpeed," and "Humidity" are crucial for understanding the environmental factors influencing wildfires, which will help with CQ1, CQ2, and CQ3.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good points. We should also include "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData" to cover data from human and earth observations. This will help us answer CQ7, CQ8, and CQ9.

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and relationships between services. We need concepts like "Mission," "Service," "Support," and "PopulationDensity" to address CQ13, CQ14, and CQ17.

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also consider the relationships between these concepts. For example, "WildfireIncident" should be linked to "Location" and "Impact," and "WeatherCondition" should be related to "WildfireIncident."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. Let's start creating the ontology in Turtle format.

**Knowledge Engineer:** This ontology should cover the key concepts and relationships needed to answer the competency questions and meet the requirements. Let's review and iterate if necessary.

**Domain Expert:** It looks comprehensive. We can refine it further based on any additional requirements or feedback.

**Knowledge Worker:** Agreed. This should provide a solid foundation for modeling SAR missions related to wildfire incidents.
