**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need to model for the Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in the context of wildfire incidents. We need to ensure our ontology can answer all the competency questions and cover the requirements.

**Domain Expert:** Absolutely. We need to capture incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. For incidents, we should include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," and "Priority."

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. For weather conditions, we should include "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast." These are crucial for understanding the fire's behavior.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good points. We also need to represent data from sensors, satellites, and social media. Let's include concepts like "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData."

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and services. We need concepts like "Mission," "Service," and "EmergencyResponse."

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also consider the relationships between these concepts. For example, a "WildfireIncident" can have a "Location," and a "Mission" can have a "Service" associated with it.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. Let's start by defining these classes and properties in our ontology. We can refine and expand as needed to ensure we can answer all the competency questions.

**Domain Expert:** We should also consider the classification of smoke and the status of forestry works. These are important for understanding the situation on the ground.

**Knowledge Worker:** Yes, and we need to ensure we can represent the location and status of vulnerable objects and people involved in the incident.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's proceed with creating the ontology in Turtle format. We'll iterate and refine as we go along.

**Generated Ontology in Turtle (TTL) Format:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** This initial version of the ontology captures the key concepts and relationships. Let's test it against the competency questions and refine it as needed.

**Domain Expert:** Agreed. We should ensure it can answer questions about weather variables, incidents, data sources, missions, and more.

**Knowledge Worker:** Let's iterate and expand the ontology until it fully meets the requirements and can answer all the competency questions.
