### Iterative Discussion

#### Round 1

**Knowledge Engineer (KE):** Alright team, let's start by defining the core classes and properties for our ontology. Our scope is wildfire incidents, so we need to capture incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. 

**Domain Expert (DE):** For incidents, we could have classes like `Incident`, `Impact`, `WeatherCondition`, `SensorData`, `SocialMediaData`, `FirstResponderInput`, `Mission`, and `Service`.

**Knowledge Worker (KW):** Agreed. We should also define properties to link these classes. For instance, `hasImpact`, `hasWeatherCondition`, `hasSensorData`, `hasSocialMediaData`, `hasFirstResponderInput`, `hasMission`, and `hasService`.

**KE:** Great. Let's start with these and then refine as we go along.

#### Round 2

**KE:** I've added the basic classes and properties. Now, let's address the competency questions. For CQ1: "What are the most important weather variables that can cause forest fire?", we need to define specific weather conditions like `Temperature`, `WindSpeed`, `Humidity`, and `WeatherForecast`.

**DE:** Yes, and we should also include properties like `hasTemperature`, `hasWindSpeed`, `hasHumidity`, and `hasWeatherForecast` to capture these variables.

**KW:** Don't forget to add properties for the measurements and forecasts.

**KE:** Done. Let's move on to CQ2 and CQ3 about current measurements and forecasts. We need to add `Measurement` and `Forecast` subclasses under `WeatherCondition`.

#### Round 3

**KE:** For CQ4: "Where did the incident take place?", we need a property `hasLocation` and a class `Location`.

**DE:** We should also add `Priority` and `Urgency` properties to address CQ5 and CQ6 about the priority and urgency of incidents.

**KW:** And for the data from human and earth observations, we need classes like `Sensor`, `Satellite`, and `SocialMediaPost`.

**KE:** Good point. Let's also add properties like `hasCreationDate`, `hasClassificationType`, `involvesVulnerableObject`, and `hasForestryWorkStatus`.

#### Round 4

**KE:** Now for the missions and relationships between services, we need to define classes like `FirefightingService`, `SupportService`, and `Mission`.

**DE:** We should also include properties like `offersService`, `followsMission`, `hasMissionLocation`, `hasUrgentMissionLocation`, `hasPopulationDensity`, and `hasInvolvedPeopleLocation`.

**KW:** This should cover all the competency questions. Let's finalize the ontology.

**KE:** Agreed. I'll compile everything into a Turtle (TTL) format.
