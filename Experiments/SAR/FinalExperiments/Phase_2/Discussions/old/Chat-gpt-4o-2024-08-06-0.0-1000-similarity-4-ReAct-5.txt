To create a comprehensive ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions focused on wildfire incidents, we will simulate a discussion among three roles: the Knowledge Engineer, the Domain Expert, and the Knowledge Worker. Each role will contribute their expertise to ensure the ontology meets all requirements and can answer the competency questions.

### Iterative Discussion

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need to model. We should first focus on incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services.

**Domain Expert:** For incidents and impacts, we need to include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," "Priority," and "Urgency." These will help us answer questions about the severity and priority of incidents.

**Knowledge Worker:** We also need to consider the data sources. We should include classes for "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData" to capture the diverse data inputs.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. We should also model weather conditions with classes like "WeatherCondition," "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast." These will help us understand environmental factors.

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and services. We need classes like "Mission," "Service," "FirefightingSupport," and "EmergencyResponse" to represent the coordination efforts.

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also include properties to link these concepts, such as "hasLocation," "hasPriority," "hasUrgency," "hasWeatherCondition," and "involvesService."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's ensure we can answer the competency questions. For example, CQ1 asks about important weather variables. We need to ensure "WeatherCondition" is linked to "WildfireIncident."

**Domain Expert:** For CQ5 and CQ6, we need to define properties like "hasPriority" and "hasUrgency" for incidents.

**Knowledge Worker:** For CQ13 to CQ18, we need to model relationships between missions and services, including their locations and involved people.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's draft the ontology in Turtle format.
