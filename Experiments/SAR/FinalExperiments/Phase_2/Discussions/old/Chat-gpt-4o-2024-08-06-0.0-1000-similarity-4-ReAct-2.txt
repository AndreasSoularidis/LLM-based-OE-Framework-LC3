**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need for our ontology. We need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. 

**Domain Expert:** For incidents and impacts, we should include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," "Location," and "Priority." These will help us answer questions like CQ4 and CQ5.

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. We also need to consider the weather conditions that affect wildfires. Concepts like "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast" are crucial for CQ1, CQ2, and CQ3.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good points. We should also include "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData" to cover the data from human and earth observations. This will help us with CQ7, CQ8, and CQ9.

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and services. We need concepts like "FirefightingService," "Mission," and "SupportService" to address CQ13, CQ14, and CQ15.

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also consider the relationships between these concepts. For example, a "WildfireIncident" can have multiple "Impacts," and a "Mission" can involve several "Services."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start modeling these concepts and relationships in our ontology. We'll use existing ontologies where possible to ensure interoperability.

**Domain Expert:** I suggest we use the "Location" concept to link incidents, data, and missions. This will help us answer questions about where things are happening, like CQ4, CQ9, and CQ15.

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also include properties to capture the status of wildfire forestry works and the classification of smoke, as these are important for CQ10 and CQ12.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. Let's also ensure we have properties to capture the creation date of data and the population density in the area, as these are relevant for CQ8 and CQ17.

**Domain Expert:** We should also consider the vulnerable objects involved in incidents, as this is important for CQ11.

**Knowledge Worker:** And let's not forget about the location of involved people, which is crucial for CQ18.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Great. Let's finalize the ontology and ensure it can answer all the competency questions.
