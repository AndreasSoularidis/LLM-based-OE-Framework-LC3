**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need to model for the Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in the context of wildfire incidents. We need to ensure our ontology can answer all the competency questions and cover the requirements.

**Domain Expert:** Absolutely. We need to capture incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. For incidents, we should include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," and "Priority."

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. For weather conditions, we should include "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast." These are crucial for understanding the fire's behavior.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good points. We also need to represent data from sensors, satellites, and social media. Let's include concepts like "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaInput."

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and services. We need concepts like "Mission," "Service," and "EmergencyResponse."

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also consider the relationships between these concepts. For example, a "WildfireIncident" can have multiple "Impacts," and a "Mission" can involve several "Services."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. Let's start defining these classes and properties in our ontology. We'll use OWL axioms to make it as expressive as possible.

**Domain Expert:** For the competency questions, we need to ensure our ontology can answer questions about weather variables, incident locations, mission priorities, and more.

**Knowledge Worker:** Yes, and we should also be able to classify smoke types, identify vulnerable objects, and assess the status of forestry works.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's proceed with creating the ontology in Turtle format.

**Generated Ontology in Turtle (TTL) Format:**
