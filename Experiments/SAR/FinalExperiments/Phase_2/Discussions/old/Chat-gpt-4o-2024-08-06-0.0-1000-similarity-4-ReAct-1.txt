**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need for our ontology. We need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. 

**Domain Expert:** For incidents and impacts, we should include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," "Location," and "Priority." These will help us answer questions like CQ4 and CQ5.

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. We also need to consider the weather conditions that affect wildfires. Concepts like "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast" are crucial for CQ1, CQ2, and CQ3.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good points. We should also include data sources like "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData" to address CQ7, CQ8, and CQ9.

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and services. We need concepts like "FirefightingService," "Mission," and "SupportService" to cover CQ13, CQ14, and CQ15.

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also consider the relationships between these concepts. For example, "WildfireIncident" should be linked to "Location" and "Impact."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. Let's start modeling these concepts and relationships in our ontology.

**Domain Expert:** We should also think about the classification of smoke and the status of forestry works, as mentioned in CQ10 and CQ12.

**Knowledge Worker:** And we need to consider the population density and the location of involved people for CQ17 and CQ18.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's incorporate these additional concepts and relationships into our ontology.

**Domain Expert:** We should also ensure that our ontology can integrate data from different sources, as mentioned in the scope.

**Knowledge Worker:** Yes, we need to make sure our ontology is comprehensive and can answer all the competency questions.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's finalize the ontology and present it in Turtle format.

**Generated Ontology in Turtle (TTL) Format:**
