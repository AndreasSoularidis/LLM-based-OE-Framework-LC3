### Iterative Discussion

#### Knowledge Engineer (KE): 
Let's start by identifying the core concepts and relationships we need to model in our ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions during wildfire incidents. We need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services.

#### Domain Expert (DE):
Sure, let's begin with the key concepts. For incidents and impacts, we need to model:
- Wildfire Incident
- Impact
- Location
- Severity
- Priority

For weather conditions, we need:
- Temperature
- Wind Speed
- Humidity
- Weather Forecast

For data from human and earth observations, we need:
- Sensor Data
- Satellite Data
- Social Media Data
- First Responder Input

For missions and relationships between services, we need:
- Mission
- Service
- Support
- Coordination

#### Knowledge Worker (KW):
We should also ensure that the ontology can answer the competency questions provided. Let's start with the first set of questions related to wildfire incidents and impacts.

**CQ1. What are the most important weather variables that can cause forest fire?**

#### KE:
We need to define classes for weather variables such as Temperature, Wind Speed, and Humidity. We also need to create relationships between these classes and the Wildfire Incident class.

**CQ2. What are the current measurements for these weather variables?**

#### DE:
We need to include properties to capture the current measurements of these weather variables. These could be data properties like hasTemperature, hasWindSpeed, and hasHumidity.

**CQ3. What is the forecast for the weather in this location?**

#### KW:
We need to model the Weather Forecast class and link it to the Location class. We should also include properties for forecasted values of temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

**CQ4. Where did the incident take place?**

#### KE:
We need a Location class with properties like hasLongitude, hasLatitude, and hasAltitude to capture the geographic details.

**CQ5. What is the priority of an incident during a forest fire disaster?**

#### DE:
We can create a Priority class and link it to the Wildfire Incident class using a property like hasPriority.

**CQ6. What incidents during forest fires are the most urgent?**

#### KW:
We need to define an Urgency class and link it to the Wildfire Incident class using a property like hasUrgency.

Let's move to the second set of competency questions related to data from human and earth observations.

**CQ7. What data from the source are depicted?**

#### KE:
We need to model classes for different data sources such as Sensor Data, Satellite Data, and Social Media Data. We should also include properties to link these data sources to the Wildfire Incident class.

**CQ8. Which is the creation date of these data?**

#### DE:
We need a property like hasCreationDate to capture the date of data creation.

**CQ9. What is the location of this item?**

#### KW:
We should ensure that all data sources have a property linking them to the Location class.

**CQ10. Which is the classification type of smoke?**

#### KE:
We need a Smoke Classification class with properties to capture different types of smoke.

**CQ11. Which vulnerable objects were involved in the incident?**

#### DE:
We can create a Vulnerable Object class and link it to the Wildfire Incident class using a property like involvesVulnerableObject.

**CQ12. What is the status of wildfire forestry works (firebreaks, access to forest roads, etc.)?**

#### KW:
We need to model classes for different types of forestry works and link them to the Wildfire Incident class using properties like hasFirebreakStatus and hasForestRoadAccess.

Finally, let's address the third set of competency questions related to missions and relationships between services.

**CQ13. What services or support do you offer for firefighting?**

#### KE:
We need to model a Service class and link it to the Mission class using a property like offersSupport.

**CQ14. Which mission do you follow for this support/service?**

#### DE:
We need a property like followsMission to link services to specific missions.

**CQ15. What is the location where this mission is taking place?**

#### KW:
We need to ensure that the Mission class has a property linking it to the Location class.

**CQ16. Where is the most urgent mission taking place?**

#### KE:
We need to link the Mission class to the Urgency class using a property like hasUrgency.

**CQ17. What is the population density in the area?**

#### DE:
We need a Population Density class and link it to the Location class using a property like hasPopulationDensity.

**CQ18. What is the location of the involved people?**

#### KW:
We need to ensure that the People class is linked to the Location class using a property like hasLocation.
