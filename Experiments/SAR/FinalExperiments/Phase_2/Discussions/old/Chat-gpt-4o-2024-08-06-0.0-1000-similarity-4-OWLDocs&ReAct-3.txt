**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need for our ontology. We need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. 

**Domain Expert:** For incidents and impacts, we should include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," "Priority," and "Urgency." These will help us answer questions about the severity and priority of incidents.

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. We also need to consider the weather conditions that affect wildfires, such as "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good points. We should also include data sources like "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData" to capture human and earth observations.

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and services involved in wildfire management. We need concepts like "FirefightingService," "Mission," and "SupportService."

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also consider the relationships between these concepts. For example, a "WildfireIncident" can have multiple "Impacts," and a "Mission" can be related to a "FirefightingService."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by defining some classes and properties in our ontology. We'll iterate and refine as we go along.

**Knowledge Engineer:** We've defined the initial set of classes and properties. Let's review and see if we can answer the competency questions.

**Domain Expert:** The ontology seems to cover the necessary concepts. We can answer questions about weather variables, incidents, data sources, and missions.

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. The ontology is comprehensive and should support decision-making in SAR missions.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Great! We've iteratively developed an ontology that meets the requirements and can answer the competency questions. Let's finalize it.
