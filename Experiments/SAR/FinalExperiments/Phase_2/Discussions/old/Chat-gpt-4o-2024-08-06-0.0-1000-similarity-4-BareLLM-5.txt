### Iterative Discussion

#### Knowledge Engineer (KE)
Let's start by identifying the main classes and properties we need for our ontology. Based on the requirements, we should have classes for `Incident`, `WeatherCondition`, `ObservationData`, `Mission`, and `Service`. We also need to define properties that capture relationships and attributes, such as `hasLocation`, `hasPriority`, `hasWeatherVariable`, and so on.

#### Domain Expert (DE)
I agree. For `Incident`, we should include properties like `hasImpact`, `hasUrgency`, and `hasPriority`. For `WeatherCondition`, we need to capture variables like `temperature`, `windSpeed`, `humidity`, and `weatherForecast`. These are crucial for understanding the fire's behavior.

#### Knowledge Worker (KW)
From a user's perspective, it would be helpful to have properties that link `ObservationData` to its `source`, `creationDate`, and `location`. This will help in tracking the data's origin and relevance.

#### KE
Good point. We should also consider the relationships between `Mission` and `Service`. For example, a `Mission` can `involveService`, and each `Service` can `supportMission`. We also need to capture the `location` and `urgency` of each mission.

#### DE
Don't forget to include classes for `VulnerableObject` and `ForestryWorkStatus`. These are important for assessing the impact and readiness of the area.

#### KW
We should also have properties like `hasPopulationDensity` and `involvesPeople` to capture human factors in the affected area.

#### KE
Let's draft the ontology in Turtle format. We'll iterate and refine it as needed.

### Final Discussion

#### KE
This draft covers the main requirements and competency questions. We have classes and properties that capture incidents, weather conditions, observation data, missions, and services.

#### DE
The ontology seems comprehensive. It includes domain-specific knowledge like vulnerable objects and forestry work status, which are crucial for SAR missions.

#### KW
From a user's perspective, the ontology is well-structured and should support decision-making during wildfire incidents. It answers all the competency questions effectively.

#### KE
Great! Let's finalize this version. The ontology is now capable of answering all the competency questions and covers the defined requirements.
