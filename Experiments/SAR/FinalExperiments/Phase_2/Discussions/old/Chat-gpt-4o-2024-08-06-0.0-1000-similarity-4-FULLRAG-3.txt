**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need to model for the Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in the context of wildfire incidents. We need to ensure our ontology can answer all the competency questions and cover the requirements.

**Domain Expert:** Absolutely. We need to capture incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. For incidents, we should include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," and "Priority."

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. For weather conditions, we should include "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast." These are crucial for understanding the fire's behavior.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good points. We also need to represent data from sensors, satellites, and social media. Let's include concepts like "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData."

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and services. We need concepts like "Mission," "Service," and "EmergencyResponse."

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also consider the relationships between these concepts. For example, a "WildfireIncident" can have a "Location," and a "Mission" can have a "Service" associated with it.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. Let's start modeling these concepts and relationships in the ontology. We'll use OWL axioms to make it as expressive as possible.

**Domain Expert:** We should also ensure that the ontology can answer the competency questions. For example, CQ1 asks about important weather variables for forest fires. We need to ensure our ontology can represent and query these variables.

**Knowledge Worker:** Yes, and for CQ13, we need to represent the services offered for firefighting. Let's make sure we have a comprehensive list of services.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's proceed with creating the ontology in Turtle format. We'll iterate and refine it until it meets all the requirements and answers all the competency questions.

**Generated Ontology in Turtle (TTL) Format:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** We've created the initial version of the ontology. Let's test it against the competency questions and refine it as needed.

**Domain Expert:** This looks comprehensive. Let's ensure it can answer all the questions and covers all the requirements.

**Knowledge Worker:** Agreed. Let's iterate and refine until we're confident it meets all the needs.
