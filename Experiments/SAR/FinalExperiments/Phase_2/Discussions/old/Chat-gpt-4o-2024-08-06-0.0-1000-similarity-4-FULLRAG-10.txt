**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need to model for the Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in the context of wildfire incidents. We need to ensure our ontology can answer all the competency questions and cover the requirements.

**Domain Expert:** Absolutely. We need to capture incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. For incidents, we should include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," and "Priority."

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. For weather conditions, we should include "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast." These are crucial for understanding the fire's behavior.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good point. We should also consider data from sensors, satellites, and social media. Let's include concepts like "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData."

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and services. We need to model "FirefightingService," "Mission," and "SupportService." These will help us coordinate emergency response efforts.

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also think about the relationships between these concepts. For example, "WildfireIncident" should have properties like "hasLocation," "hasPriority," and "hasImpact."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. Let's also define properties for weather conditions, such as "hasTemperature," "hasWindSpeed," and "hasHumidity." For data sources, we can use "hasCreationDate" and "hasLocation."

**Domain Expert:** We should also consider the classification of smoke and the status of forestry works. Let's include "SmokeClassification" and "ForestryWorkStatus."

**Knowledge Worker:** And for missions, we need properties like "hasService," "hasMissionLocation," and "hasUrgency."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Great. Let's start creating the ontology in Turtle format.

**Knowledge Engineer:** This ontology should cover all the requirements and answer the competency questions. Let's review and iterate if necessary.

**Domain Expert:** It looks comprehensive. We can refine it further based on feedback from real-world applications.

**Knowledge Worker:** Agreed. This should provide a solid foundation for decision support in wildfire SAR missions.
