### Iterative Discussion

#### Round 1: Initial Requirements Specification

**Knowledge Engineer (KE):**
Alright, team, we need to create an ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions focused on wildfire incidents. Our key knowledge areas are Incidents and Impacts, Weather Conditions, Data from Human and Earth Observations, and Missions and Relationships Between Services. Let's start by identifying the primary classes and properties we need.

**Domain Expert (DE):**
We need classes for incidents, weather conditions, data sources (sensors, social media), and missions. For incidents, we should consider properties like location, priority, and urgency. Weather conditions should include temperature, wind speed, humidity, and forecasts.

**Knowledge Worker (KW):**
For data sources, we need to capture the type of data, creation date, and location. Missions should include the services offered, the mission followed, and the location of the mission.

**KE:**
Let's define some initial classes and properties:
- Classes: Incident, WeatherCondition, DataSource, Mission, Service
- Properties: hasLocation, hasPriority, hasUrgency, hasTemperature, hasWindSpeed, hasHumidity, hasForecast, hasDataType, hasCreationDate, hasMission, hasService

#### Round 2: Conceptualization and Refinement

**KE:**
We need to refine our initial classes and properties. For example, we should create subclasses for different types of incidents and data sources.

**DE:**
For incidents, we can have subclasses like WildfireIncident and its impacts. For data sources, we can have SensorData, SatelliteData, and SocialMediaData.

**KW:**
We should also consider the relationships between these classes. For example, a Mission is related to a Service, and an Incident has a Location.

**KE:**
Good point. Let's add these relationships:
- Subclasses: WildfireIncident, SensorData, SatelliteData, SocialMediaData
- Relationships: Mission hasService Service, Incident hasLocation Location

#### Round 3: Integration and Validation

**KE:**
Let's integrate these classes and properties into a coherent ontology. We'll also need to validate it against our competency questions.

**DE:**
We should ensure that we can answer questions about weather variables, current measurements, forecast, incident location, priority, and urgency.

**KW:**
We also need to capture data from human and earth observations, including creation date, location, smoke classification, and the status of forestry works.

**KE:**
Let's define the ontology in Turtle format and validate it against our competency questions.
