**Iterative Discussion:**

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need for our ontology. We need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. 

**Domain Expert:** For incidents and impacts, we should include concepts like "WildfireIncident," "Impact," "Priority," and "Urgency." These will help us answer questions about the severity and priority of incidents.

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. We also need to consider the weather conditions that affect wildfires. Concepts like "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast" are crucial.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good points. We should also include data sources like "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData" to capture human and earth observations.

**Domain Expert:** Don't forget about the missions and services. We need concepts like "FirefightingService," "Mission," and "SupportService" to represent the relationships and coordination efforts.

**Knowledge Worker:** We should also think about the relationships between these concepts. For example, a "WildfireIncident" can have multiple "Impacts," and a "Mission" can be linked to a "FirefightingService."

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start modeling these concepts and relationships in OWL. We'll use classes, properties, and axioms to make the ontology expressive.

**Domain Expert:** We should also consider the competency questions. For example, CQ1 asks about important weather variables for forest fires. We need to ensure our ontology can represent and query these variables.

**Knowledge Worker:** Yes, and for CQ13, we need to represent the services and support offered for firefighting. Our ontology should be able to answer these questions effectively.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Agreed. Let's proceed with creating the ontology in Turtle format.

**Knowledge Engineer:** This ontology should cover the key concepts and relationships needed for SAR missions in wildfire incidents. It also addresses the competency questions by allowing queries about weather variables, data sources, and services.

**Domain Expert:** Excellent. This ontology captures the necessary domain knowledge and provides a solid foundation for decision support in crisis management.

**Knowledge Worker:** I agree. This ontology will be very useful for integrating and analyzing data from various sources during wildfire emergencies.
