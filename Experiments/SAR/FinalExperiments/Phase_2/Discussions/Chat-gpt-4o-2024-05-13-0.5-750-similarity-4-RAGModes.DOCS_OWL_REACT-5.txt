### Iterative Discussion

#### Initial Meeting

**Knowledge Engineer (KE):** 
Alright team, our goal is to create an ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions with a focus on wildfire incidents. We need to ensure the ontology can capture, link, and semantically integrate data from various sources like sensors, social media, and first responders. Let's start by identifying the key concepts and their relationships.

**Domain Expert (DE):**
To begin with, we'll need to include concepts related to incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and the missions and relationships between services. For incidents, we need to capture the severity, location, and priority.

**Knowledge Worker (KW):**
I will be using this ontology to support decision-making during SAR missions. It's crucial that it includes real-time data like current weather conditions and forecasts, as well as the status of ongoing missions and their locations.

#### Conceptualization

**KE:**
Let's define some primary classes: `Incident`, `WeatherCondition`, `SensorData`, `Mission`, `Service`, and `Location`. We will also need properties to link these classes.

**DE:**
For incidents, we need subclasses like `WildfireIncident`, `Impact`, and `Priority`. Weather conditions should include attributes like temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

**KW:**
We should also capture the data source, creation date, and location for sensor data. For missions, we need to know the type of mission, its status, and the services involved.

#### Refinement

**KE:**
Let's define the relationships. For example, an `Incident` can have a `hasImpact` relationship with `Impact`. A `WeatherCondition` can have properties like `hasTemperature`, `hasWindSpeed`, and `hasHumidity`.

**DE:**
We should also include relationships like `hasDataSource` for `SensorData` and `isPartOf` for linking `Mission` to `Service`.

**KW:**
Don't forget to include properties for capturing the status and location of missions, such as `hasStatus` and `hasLocation`.

#### Finalization

**KE:**
We've defined the core concepts and relationships. Let's ensure our ontology can answer the competency questions. For example, CQ1 requires identifying weather variables that can cause forest fires. We'll need to include `Temperature`, `WindSpeed`, and `Humidity` as key weather variables.

**DE:**
For CQ4, `Incident` should have a `hasLocation` property. For CQ13, `Service` should have a `providesSupport` property linked to `Firefighting`.

**KW:**
For CQ16, we need to link `Mission` to `Location` and have a property to indicate urgency, like `isUrgent`.

**KE:**
Great, let's implement these in Turtle format.
