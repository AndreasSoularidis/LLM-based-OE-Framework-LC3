### Iterative Discussion

#### Knowledge Engineer (KE), Domain Expert (DE), and Knowledge Worker (KW)

**KE:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need to include in our ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions focused on wildfire incidents. We need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services.

**DE:** Absolutely. For incidents and impacts, we need to capture the location, severity, and priority of the incidents. For weather conditions, we should include temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather forecasts.

**KW:** Don't forget that we also need to include data from various sources like sensors, satellites, and social media. This will help us monitor and assess the wildfire situation in real-time.

**KE:** Good point. We also need to represent the missions and the relationships between the services involved in wildfire management. This will help in coordinating and organizing emergency response efforts.

**DE:** Let's start by defining the main classes: `Incident`, `WeatherCondition`, `ObservationData`, `Mission`, and `Service`.

**KW:** We should also define properties to link these classes. For example, `hasLocation`, `hasSeverity`, `hasPriority` for `Incident`, and `hasTemperature`, `hasWindSpeed`, `hasHumidity` for `WeatherCondition`.

**KE:** Agreed. Let's also include properties like `hasSource`, `hasCreationDate`, and `hasClassificationType` for `ObservationData`. For `Mission`, we can have properties like `hasService`, `hasLocation`, and `hasUrgency`.

**DE:** We should also consider the competency questions. For example, CQ1 asks about the most important weather variables that can cause forest fires. We need to ensure our ontology can answer this.

**KW:** Yes, and for CQ2, we need to capture the current measurements for these weather variables. This means we need to include properties to store these measurements.

**KE:** Let's start by defining the classes and properties in Turtle format. We can iterate and refine as we go along.

### Iterative Refinement

**KE:** Let's review the competency questions to ensure our ontology can answer them.

**DE:** For CQ1, we need to identify the most important weather variables that can cause forest fires. We have `hasTemperature`, `hasWindSpeed`, and `hasHumidity` in `WeatherCondition`.

**KW:** For CQ2, we need the current measurements for these weather variables. We have properties to store these measurements.

**KE:** For CQ3, we need the weather forecast. We have `hasForecast` in `WeatherCondition`.

**DE:** For CQ4, we need the location of the incident. We have `hasLocation` in `Incident`.

**KW:** For CQ5 and CQ6, we need the priority and urgency of incidents. We have `hasPriority` and `hasUrgency`.

**KE:** For CQ7 to CQ12, we need to capture data from various sources. We have `ObservationData` with properties like `hasSource`, `hasCreationDate`, and `hasClassificationType`.

**DE:** For CQ13 to CQ18, we need to represent missions and relationships between services. We have `Mission` and `Service` with properties like `hasService`, `hasLocation`, and `hasUrgency`.

**KW:** It looks like our ontology covers all the requirements and can answer the competency questions. Let's finalize it.
