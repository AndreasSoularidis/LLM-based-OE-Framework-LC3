### Iterative Discussion

#### Knowledge Engineer (KE), Domain Expert (DE), and Knowledge Worker (KW)

**KE:** Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need to model for our Search and Rescue (SAR) missions ontology focused on wildfire incidents. We need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services.

**DE:** Sure, we need to capture incidents like "Wildfire," "Impact," and "IncidentLocation." For weather conditions, we should include "Temperature," "WindSpeed," "Humidity," and "WeatherForecast."

**KW:** Don't forget about the data sources. We need to include "SensorData," "SatelliteData," and "SocialMediaData." Also, we need to model the relationships between different services involved in wildfire management.

**KE:** Agreed. Let's start by defining the main classes and properties. We can refine and add more details as we go along.

**DE:** For incidents and impacts, we need to capture the severity and priority of incidents. We should also include the location and type of impact.

**KW:** For weather conditions, we need to capture current measurements and forecasts. This will help in assessing the potential spread and behavior of the fire.

**KE:** Let's also include properties to link data from different sources to specific incidents. This will help in providing a comprehensive view of the situation.

**DE:** We should also model the missions and the relationships between different services. This will help in coordinating and organizing emergency response efforts.

**KW:** Agreed. Let's start with these concepts and refine them as we go along.
