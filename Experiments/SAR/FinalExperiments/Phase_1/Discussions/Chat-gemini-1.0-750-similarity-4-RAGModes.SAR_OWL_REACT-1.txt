## HCOME-based Ontology Engineering for Search and Rescue (SAR) in Wildfire Incidents

**Iteration 1**

**KE:** Welcome everyone. Our goal is to create an ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in wildfire incidents. We need to capture information about incidents, weather, observations, and missions.  What are the most critical concepts we should include in our ontology?

**DE:** We need to represent the different types of land cover affected by wildfires, such as forests, grasslands, and agricultural lands. It is also crucial to include information about weather conditions like temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

**KW:** From a user perspective, it is essential to have information about the location and priority of incidents, as well as any reported casualties or rescues.

**KE:** Great! Let's start building our ontology based on this information.

**Iteration 2**

**KE:**  We have a good starting point. Now, let's dive deeper into data from observations. What kind of information do we collect?

**DE:** We gather data from various sources like weather forecasts, satellite imagery, sensor networks, and social media. This data includes information about fire boundaries, smoke plumes, weather patterns, and even reports from people in the affected areas.

**KW:** It would be beneficial for us to be able to track the source and timestamp of these observations to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

**KE:** Absolutely. We should also consider including concepts related to different types of observations, such as visual observations, sensor readings, and social media posts.
