### Iterative Discussion

#### Round 1: Initial Discussion

**Knowledge Engineer (KE):**
Alright, team, we need to create an ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions focused on wildfire incidents. Let's start by identifying the main concepts and relationships we need to include.

**Domain Expert (DE):**
We need to capture incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. Key concepts should include "Incident," "WeatherCondition," "SensorData," "Mission," and "Service."

**Knowledge Worker (KW):**
We should also consider the competency questions. For example, CQ1 asks about important weather variables that can cause forest fires. We need to include concepts like "Temperature," "WindSpeed," and "Humidity."

**KE:**
Good point. Let's start by defining the main classes and some properties. We can refine and expand as we go.

#### Round 2: Defining Initial Classes and Properties

**KE:**
I've created initial classes: `Incident`, `WeatherCondition`, `SensorData`, `Mission`, and `Service`. I've also added properties like `hasLocation`, `hasPriority`, and `hasWeatherCondition`.

**DE:**
We need to specify subclasses for `WeatherCondition` like `Temperature`, `WindSpeed`, and `Humidity`. Also, for `Incident`, we should have subclasses like `Fire`, `Smoke`, and `Resurgence`.

**KW:**
Don't forget to include properties for capturing data from sensors and social media, like `hasSensorData` and `hasSocialMediaData`.

**KE:**
Got it. I'll add those and also include properties for `Mission` like `hasService`, `hasLocation`, and `hasUrgency`.

#### Round 3: Refining and Adding More Details

**KE:**
I've added subclasses and properties as discussed. Now, let's focus on the competency questions. For example, CQ4 asks about the location of the incident. We need to ensure `Incident` has a property `hasLocation`.

**DE:**
We should also include properties for capturing the status of wildfire forestry works, like `firebreakStatus` and `accessToForestRoads`.

**KW:**
For CQ13, we need to represent services offered for firefighting. Let's add subclasses for `Service` like `Firefighting`, `MedicalAid`, and `Evacuation`.

**KE:**
I'll add those and also include properties to link `Service` to `Mission`.

#### Round 4: Finalizing and Ensuring Coverage

**KE:**
I've added the necessary subclasses and properties. Let's review the competency questions to ensure our ontology can answer them.

**DE:**
For CQ6, we need to identify the most urgent incidents. We should add a property `hasUrgencyLevel` to `Incident`.

**KW:**
For CQ17, we need to capture population density. Let's add a property `hasPopulationDensity` to `Location`.

**KE:**
Great. I'll make those additions. Let's finalize the ontology and ensure it covers all requirements.
