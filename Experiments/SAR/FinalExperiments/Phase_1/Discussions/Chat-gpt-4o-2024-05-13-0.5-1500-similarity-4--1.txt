### Iterative Discussion

#### Knowledge Engineer (KE): 
Alright team, we need to create an ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, specifically for wildfire incidents. Let's start by defining the core concepts and relationships. 

#### Domain Expert (DE): 
Sure, we need to cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. 

#### Knowledge Worker (KW): 
I agree. We need to ensure that the ontology can answer specific competency questions related to these areas. Let's start with defining the most critical concepts and properties.

#### KE: 
Great. Let's start with the concept of "Incident." This should include properties like location, priority, and type of incident.

#### DE: 
For incidents, we also need to capture the form of fire, starting point, and starting position. These are crucial for understanding the nature of the wildfire.

#### KW: 
And don't forget the weather conditions. We need to include variables like temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

#### KE: 
Alright, I’ll define the "Incident" class and add the necessary properties. Let's also define a "WeatherCondition" class to capture the weather variables.

#### DE: 
We should also consider data from sensors, satellites, and social media. These should be subclasses under a "DataSource" class.

#### KW: 
Good point. We need to capture the creation date, location, and type of data for each data source.

#### KE: 
I'll add these subclasses and properties. Now, let's define "Mission" and its relationships with services.

#### DE: 
"Missions" should include properties like location, urgency, and the services involved. We need to capture the relationships between different services.

#### KW: 
We should also consider the population density and the location of involved people. This is crucial for decision-making.

#### KE: 
Alright, I’ll define the "Mission" class and add these properties. Let's review and ensure we can answer all competency questions.

#### DE: 
We should now check if we can answer questions like the most important weather variables for forest fires, current measurements, and forecasts.

#### KW: 
Yes, and also questions about incidents, their locations, priorities, and urgency.

#### KE: 
Alright, let's finalize the ontology and ensure it covers all requirements.
