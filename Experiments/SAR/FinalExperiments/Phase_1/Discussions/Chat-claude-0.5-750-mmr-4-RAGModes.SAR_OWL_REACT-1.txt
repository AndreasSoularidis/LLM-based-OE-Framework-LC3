I'll simulate a conversation between the three roles to create the SAR ontology for wildfire incidents.

Knowledge Engineer (KE): Hello! Let's start creating the ontology for SAR missions focusing on wildfire incidents. First, I'd like to hear from our domain expert about the key concepts we should model.

Domain Expert (DE): Based on my experience, we need to model several critical aspects:
1. The incident itself (wildfire) and its characteristics
2. Environmental conditions, especially weather
3. Resources and response teams
4. Affected areas and assets
5. Data sources for situational awareness

Knowledge Worker (KW): As a user, I need the ontology to help me:
1. Track incident priorities
2. Monitor weather conditions
3. Coordinate resources
4. Access sensor and social media data
5. Track mission status

KE: Let me start with a basic structure in Turtle format:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.com/sar/> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

# Classes
:Incident rdf:type owl:Class .
:Wildfire rdfs:subClassOf :Incident .
:WeatherCondition rdf:type owl:Class .
:Mission rdf:type owl:Class .
:Resource rdf:type owl:Class .
:Location rdf:type owl:Class .
:DataSource rdf:type owl:Class .

# Properties
:hasLocation rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
:hasPriority rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
:hasWeatherCondition rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
:involvesMission rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
:requiresResource rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty .
```

DE: We need to add more specific classes for weather conditions and affected areas. Also, don't forget about the forces involved in firefighting.

KW: And we need classes for data sources like sensors and social media.

[Conversation continues... Would you like me to proceed with the detailed development?]
