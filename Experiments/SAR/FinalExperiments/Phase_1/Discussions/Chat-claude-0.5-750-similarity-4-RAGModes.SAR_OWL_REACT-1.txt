I'll simulate a conversation between the three roles to create a SAR ontology for wildfire incidents. Let's begin:

Knowledge Engineer (KE): Hello everyone. We need to create an ontology for Search and Rescue missions focusing on wildfire incidents. Let's start by discussing the main concepts based on the requirements.

Domain Expert (DE): I've been involved in numerous wildfire operations. The key aspects we need to model are the incident details, environmental conditions, various data sources, and mission coordination.

Knowledge Worker (KW): As a user, I need to track incidents, monitor sensor data, and coordinate rescue missions. The system should help in decision making during emergencies.

KE: Let's start with the core concepts. From the requirements, I see we need to model incidents, weather conditions, observations, and missions.

DE: Correct. For weather conditions, the critical variables are temperature, wind speed, humidity, and wind direction. These significantly affect fire behavior.

KW: We also need to track different types of affected areas like forests, grasslands, and agricultural lands.

KE: I'll start defining the main classes and properties. Here's the initial ontology structure:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/sar#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

```

DE: We should add more specific classes for vulnerable objects and emergency services.

KW: Yes, and we need to model the classification of smoke and infrastructure status.

Let's continue expanding the ontology to cover all requirements and competency questions. Would you like to proceed with adding more specific classes
