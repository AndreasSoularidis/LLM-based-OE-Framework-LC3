### Iterative Discussion

#### Round 1

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's start by identifying the key classes we need in our ontology. We need classes for incidents, weather conditions, data sources, missions, and services. 

**Domain Expert:** Agreed. For incidents, we can have subclasses like Wildfire, Impact, and Location. Weather conditions should include Temperature, WindSpeed, Humidity, and WeatherForecast.

**Knowledge Worker:** Don't forget the data sources. We need classes for Sensors, Satellites, and SocialMedia. For missions, we can have FirefightingMission, RescueMission, and SupportMission. Services should include FirefightingService, MedicalService, and LogisticalSupport.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Good. Let's also define relationships between these classes. For instance, an Incident can have a Location, WeatherCondition, and DataSource. Missions should be linked to Services and Locations.

#### Round 2

**Knowledge Engineer:** Let's refine the properties. For incidents, we'll need properties like hasLocation, hasWeatherCondition, and hasImpact. For weather conditions, we need properties like hasTemperature, hasWindSpeed, hasHumidity, and hasWeatherForecast.

**Domain Expert:** We should also include properties to capture data from human and earth observations, like hasSensorData, hasSatelliteData, and hasSocialMediaData. 

**Knowledge Worker:** For missions and services, we need properties like supportsMission, providesService, and operatesInLocation.

**Knowledge Engineer:** Perfect. Let's start modeling these in Turtle format.
