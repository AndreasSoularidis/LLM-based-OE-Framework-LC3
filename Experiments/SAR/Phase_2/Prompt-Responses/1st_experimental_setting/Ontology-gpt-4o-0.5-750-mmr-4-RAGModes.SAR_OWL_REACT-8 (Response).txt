### Iterative Discussion

**Knowledge Engineer (KE):** Welcome, everyone. Our goal today is to create a comprehensive ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, specifically focusing on wildfire incidents. Let's start by identifying the core concepts and relationships we need to capture.

**Domain Expert (DE):** Sure. We need to capture incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. We should also ensure that our ontology can answer specific competency questions.

**Knowledge Worker (KW):** I agree. Let's start by identifying the crucial concepts and properties for incidents and impacts. 

**KE:** Great. For incidents and impacts, we need to capture details like the cause of the fire, affected areas, response composition, and firefighting resources. We also need to represent weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather forecasts.

**DE:** Don't forget about data from sensors, satellites, and social media. This data is crucial for monitoring and assessing the wildfire situation.

**KW:** And we need to represent missions and the relationships between services involved in wildfire management. This will help coordinate and organize emergency response efforts.

**KE:** Let's start by defining the core classes and properties. We'll use existing ontologies where possible to ensure interoperability.

### Core Classes and Properties

**KE:** We'll start with the following classes:
- `Incident`
- `WeatherCondition`
- `DataSource`
- `Mission`
- `Service`
- `Location`
- `Impact`
- `FireCause`
- `FirefightingResource`

**DE:** For the properties, we need:
- `hasLocation`
- `hasWeatherCondition`
- `hasDataSource`
- `hasMission`
- `hasService`
- `hasImpact`
- `hasFireCause`
- `hasFirefightingResource`

**KW:** Let's also include properties to capture specific details like `temperature`, `windSpeed`, `humidity`, `weatherForecast`, and `priority`.

**KE:** Agreed. Let's define these properties and start mapping them to our competency questions.

### Mapping to Competency Questions

**KE:** For the first set of competency questions, we need to capture weather variables and their measurements. We'll add properties like `temperature`, `windSpeed`, `humidity`, and `weatherForecast` to `WeatherCondition`.

**DE:** We also need to capture the location of incidents and their priority. We'll add properties like `incidentLocation` and `incidentPriority` to `Incident`.

**KW:** For the second set of competency questions, we need to capture data from various sources. We'll add properties like `dataSource`, `creationDate`, `dataLocation`, and `smokeClassification` to `DataSource`.

**KE:** For the third set, we need to capture missions and services. We'll add properties like `serviceOffered`, `missionLocation`, and `populationDensity` to `Mission` and `Service`.

**DE:** Let's also include properties for vulnerable objects involved in the incident and the status of wildfire forestry works.

**KW:** Agreed. Let's add these properties and start defining the ontology in Turtle format.
