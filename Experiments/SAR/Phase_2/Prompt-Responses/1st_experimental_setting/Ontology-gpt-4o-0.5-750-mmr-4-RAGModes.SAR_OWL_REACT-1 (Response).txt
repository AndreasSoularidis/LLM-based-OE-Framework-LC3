### Iterative Discussion

**Knowledge Engineer (KE):** 
Alright, team. We need to create a comprehensive ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, focusing specifically on wildfire incidents. Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships we need to include. 

**Domain Expert (DE):**
Sure. We need to capture incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services. We should also consider the competency questions to ensure our ontology is comprehensive.

**Knowledge Worker (KW):**
Got it. Let's begin by defining the main classes. For incidents and impacts, we need classes like `Incident`, `Impact`, `WeatherCondition`, `HumanObservation`, `EarthObservation`, `Mission`, and `Service`.

**KE:**
Good start. Let's also define some object properties to link these classes. For example, `hasImpact`, `hasWeatherCondition`, `hasObservation`, `hasMission`, and `hasService`.

**DE:**
Don't forget to include specific attributes for these classes. For example, `WeatherCondition` should have attributes like `temperature`, `windSpeed`, `humidity`, and `weatherForecast`.

**KW:**
Right. We also need to capture data from sensors, social media, and first responders. So, we should have subclasses like `SensorData`, `SocialMediaData`, and `FirstResponderInput` under `HumanObservation` and `EarthObservation`.

**KE:**
Let's also ensure we can answer the competency questions. For example, CQ1 asks about important weather variables. We need to include properties like `temperature`, `windSpeed`, and `humidity` under `WeatherCondition`.

**DE:**
For CQ4, we need to capture the location of incidents. So, we should have a property `hasLocation` linked to a `Location` class.

**KW:**
We also need to capture the priority and urgency of incidents (CQ5 and CQ6). So, let's add properties like `hasPriority` and `hasUrgency` to the `Incident` class.

**KE:**
Alright, let's start creating the ontology in Turtle format. We'll iterate and refine as we go along.

**KE:**
This should cover most of our requirements. Let's review and make sure all competency questions can be answered.

**DE:**
Looks good. We can answer questions about weather variables, incident locations, priorities, and urgencies. We also covered data from human and earth observations and relationships between missions and services.

**KW:**
Agreed. We have a well-connected and expressive ontology. I think we can finalize it now.

**KE:**
Great job, team. This ontology should serve well for SAR missions focusing on wildfire incidents.
