### Iterative Discussion

#### Knowledge Engineer (KE): 
Alright team, let's get started on building this ontology for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions focused on wildfire incidents. Our goal is to model all necessary concepts and relationships to capture, link, and semantically integrate heterogeneous data from various sources for decision support.

#### Domain Expert (DE): 
Absolutely. We need to ensure we cover incidents and impacts, weather conditions, data from human and earth observations, and missions and relationships between services involved in wildfire management.

#### Knowledge Worker (KW): 
Got it. Let's start by identifying the key concepts and relationships. For incidents and impacts, we need to capture causes of fire, affected areas, and the severity of incidents.

#### KE: 
Let's define a class `Incident` and subclasses for different types of incidents, such as `WildfireIncident`. We also need to capture the cause of the fire. 

#### DE: 
We should also include classes for `WeatherCondition` with properties for temperature, wind speed, and humidity. These are crucial for understanding the behavior of the wildfire.

#### KW: 
For data from human and earth observations, we need classes to represent sensor data, satellite data, and social media inputs. 

#### KE: 
Let's create classes `SensorData`, `SatelliteData`, and `SocialMediaData`. We also need properties to link these data sources to incidents and locations.

#### DE: 
For missions and relationships between services, we should have classes like `Mission`, `Service`, and `Support`. We need properties to link these to incidents and locations as well.

#### KW: 
Agreed. Let's also consider the competence questions. For example, CQ1 asks about important weather variables causing forest fires. We need to ensure our ontology can answer this.

#### KE: 
We can create data properties like `hasTemperature`, `hasWindSpeed`, and `hasHumidity` for the `WeatherCondition` class. 

#### DE: 
For CQ4, which asks about the location of the incident, we need a property `hasLocation` linking `Incident` to `Location`.

#### KW: 
For CQ6, which asks about the priority of incidents, we can add a property `hasPriority` to the `Incident` class.

#### KE: 
Let's also ensure we can answer questions related to human and earth observations. For CQ7, we need properties like `hasSource` and `hasCreationDate` for data classes.

#### DE: 
For missions, we need properties like `hasMissionType`, `hasLocation`, and `hasUrgency` to answer questions like CQ13 and CQ16.

#### KW: 
Great. Let's start defining these classes and properties in Turtle format.
