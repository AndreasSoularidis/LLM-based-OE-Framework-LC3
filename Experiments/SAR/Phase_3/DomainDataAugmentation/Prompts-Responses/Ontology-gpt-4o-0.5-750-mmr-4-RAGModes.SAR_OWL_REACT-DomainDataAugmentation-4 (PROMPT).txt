    Create three instances of yourself playing three different roles in the ontology engineering process 
    based on the HCOME collaborative ontology engineering methodology.
    The three roles are the knowledge engineer, the domain expert and the knowledge worker. 
    These three roles work together to create an ontology. The Knowledge Engineer is responsible 
    for the requirements specification, conceptualisation and generation of the ontology. The Domain 
    Expert is an experienced person and provides the requirements for the 
    ontology, terminology, definitions of terms, domain specific explanations of terms and his 
    experience in general. The Knowledge Worker is the user of the ontology 
    and actively participates in the ontology engineering process. The above roles should express 
    their deep knowledge during the conversation. Their aim is to play all three roles, simulating 
    the HCOME methodology. The above mentioned roles will interact with each other, asking and 
    answering questions until a valid and comprehensive ontology is created, which covers all 
    the defined requirements below.
  The aim of the ontology to be created is to model all the necessary concepts and their relationships for Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. The scope of the ontology is wildfire incidents. The generated ontology should be able to capture, link and semantically integrate heterogeneous data, regarding the environment in which the mission takes place, collected from different resources such as sensors, social media (from users in the nearby area), and input from first responders, in order to provide decision support services to the crisis management centre.Therefore, the generated ontology should have a deep scope, encompassing a wide range of domain knowledge relevant to forest fire emergencies. The key knowledge that must be represented in your ontology includes: A. Incidents and Impacts: The ontology must capture relevant incidents and impacts in a wildfire disaster. This knowledge is crucial for understanding  the extent and severity of the wildfire and its consequences. B. Weather Conditions: Representation of weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather forecasts, is essential for understanding the environmental factors influencing the behavior of the wildfire. This knowledge helps in assessing the potential spread and behavior of the fire. C. Data from Human and Earth Observations: The ontology must include data relevant to the analysis of input data coming from various type of sensors, satellites, and social media sources. This knowledge provides valuable information for monitoring and assessing the wildfire situation. D. Missions and Relationships Between Services: Representation of missions and relationships between the services involved in wildfire management is important for coordinating and organizing emergency response efforts.Moreover, you will be given three sets of competence questions. The competency questions are the following: The first set aims to represent the wildfire disaster and relevant incident and impacts: CQ1. What are the most important weather variables that can cause forest fire? CQ2. What are the current measurements for these weather variables? CQ3. What is the forecast for the weather in this location? CQ4. Where did the incident take place? CQ5. What is the priority of an incident during a forest fire disaster? CQ6. What incidents during forest fires are the most urgent? Set of CQs that you must take into account related data from human and earth observations: CQ7. What data from the source are depicted? CQ8. Which is the creation date of these data? CQ9. What is the location of this item? CQ10. Which is the classification type of smoke? CQ11. Which vulnerable objects were involved in the incident? CQ12. What is the status of wildfire forestry works (firebreaks, access to forest roads, etc.)? The last set of CQs that your ontology must answer is related to the representation of missions and relationships between the services: CQ13. What services or support do you offer for firefighting? CQ14. Which mission do you follow for this support/service? CQ15. What is the location where this mission is taking place? CQ16. Where is the most urgent mission taking place? CQ17. What is the population density in the area? CQ18. What is the location of the involved people? Your ultimate goal is to generate a comprehensive ontology that covers all of the above requirements and is capable of answering the above questions. You need to create an extensive, comprehensive and well-connected ontology using all the necessary owl axioms to meet all the above requirements.  
    
During the discussion and design of the ontology you should consider the following additional content. 
    You should follow the above way of thinking-acting-observing, but BEHIND THE SCENES and WITHOUT showing this thinking chain during the discussion and the ontology generation process, as given below
    START OF REACT

    Question: How should a new ontology be created to meet the given aim and scope?

Thought 1: To avoid duplicating existing knowledge, I should first check if there are established ontologies relevant to this domain.

Action 1: Search the web for ontologies related to this domain.

Observation 1: I have found several related ontologies in this area.

Thought 2: To keep the ontology focused and practical, I should only consider the most widely used and currently maintained (live) ontologies.

Action 2: Review the list of existing ontologies and select only those that are widely used and currently maintained.

Observation 2: I now have a refined list of widely used, live ontologies for reference.

Response: The new data property, representing a connection between a class and a literal, was successfully added to the ontology. The owl:DatatypeProperty, rdfs:domain, and rdfs:range axioms were created, and the property was defined as a subproperty of the appropriate existing data property where applicable.

Thought 5: To establish equivalence, I should define the relationship using the owl:equivalentProperty axiom.

Action 5: Define equivalency using the owl:equivalentProperty axiom.

Observation 5: The equivalency relationships have been successfully defined.

Thought 6: I should investigate if the new object property has any inverse relationships with other properties in the ontology.

Action 6: Check for any inverse object properties in the ontology.

Observation 6: There are object properties that are inverses of the new object property.

Thought 7: I should define these inverse relationships using the owl:inverseOf axiom.

Action 7: Apply the owl:inverseOf axiom to establish inverse relationships.

Action 3: Search the web for the IRI of the existing class in the external ontology.

Observation 3: I have obtained the IRI of the class.

Thought 4: I should add a new class to the ontology, defining a representative label and comment for it.

Action 4: Create the new class in the ontology, setting a label and comment using owl:Class, rdfs:label, and rdfs:comment axioms.

Observation 4: The new class has been successfully added with label and comment.

Thought 5: I should determine if the new class represents a more specific subtype of another class in the ontology.

Action 5: Investigate whether the new class should be a subclass of an existing class.

Observation 5: The new class is indeed a more specific type of an existing class.

    You should also use the some of the following OWL axioms to make the ontology as expressive as possible. Use ONLY the ontology axioms given in the examples and not the data presented.
    You do not need to use all of them, but only the necessary axioms to create a WELL CONNECTED and EXPRESSIVE ontology.

    The iterative discussion stops when the generated ontology answers all the given competency questions and covers all the requirements of the ontology. 
    Thus create as many classes and properties as possible.
    Feel free to use domain knowledge to extend the ontology with classes and properties to make it as comprehensive as possible. 
    DO NOT STOP until cover all the given requirements.
    Present the iterative discussion and the generated ontology in Turtle (TTL) format WITHOUT individuals.
