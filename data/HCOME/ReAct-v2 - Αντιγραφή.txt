Example 1
Question: A new ontology needs to be created about the given aim and scope. How will this be done?
Thought 1: I should search the Web for existing ontologies in the given domain. 
Action 1: Search the web for existing ontologies related to this domain.
Observation 1: In this area, there are a number of related ontologies available.
Thought 2: I should only include the most widely used, and live ontologies.
Action 2: Of the existing ontologies I keep only the most widely used and live ones.
Thought 3: I should get the IRIs of the existing ontologies.
Action 3: Web search for the IRIs of existing ontologies
Observation 3: Now I have the ontologies' IRIs to integrate them into the generated ontology
Response: During the ontology engineering process i will reuse the most suitable existing ontologies using the required prefixes


Example 2
Question: A new concept must be inserted in the ontology. How will this be implemented? 
Thought 1: I need to check if this concept is already modeled in the current version of the ontology. 
Action 1: Check if this concept is already modeled in the ontology. 
Observation 1: The given concept is not modeled in the current version of the ontology. 
Thought 2: It should be investigated if it can be added as a rdfs:subClassOf of a relevant owl:Class.
Action 2: Investigate if the concept can be added as a rdfs:subClassOf of a relevant owl:Class
Observation 2: The new concept needs to be added as a rdfs:subClassOfof the relevant owl:Class. Also It should be annotated using rdfs:label and rdfs:comment.
Action 2: Create a new owl:Class for the given concept defining also the rdfs:label and a representative rdfs:comment. 
Observation 2: The inserted owl:Class should be connected with other existing classes. 
Thought 3: Possible links with existing owl:Class (owl:ObjectProperty) must be investigated.
Action 3: Investigate possible links with other existing owl:Class, create the appropriate owl:ObjectProperty, and define the rdfs:domain and rdfs:range.
Observation 3: The new owl:Class and related owl:ObjectProperty were inserted successfully.
Thought 4: It should be investigated if one or more owl:equivalentClass exist in the current version of the ontology.
Action 4: Investigate possible existence of owl:equivalentClass in the current version of the ontology.
Observation 4: There is owl:Class that is owl:equivalentClass with the new owl:Class.
Thought 5: It should be investigated if owl:disjointWith owl:Class exist.
Action 5: Investigate possible existence of owl:disjointWith classes. 
Observation 5: There owl:Class that are owl:disjointWith the new owl:Class.
Thought 6: So, the owl:equivalentClass and owl:disjointWith axioms should be defined 
Action 6: Define the owl:equivalentClass and owl:disjointWith axioms.
Observation 6: The axioms are inserted successfully.
Response: A new owl:Class, representing the given concept was successfully inserted into the ontology, the new owl:ObjectProperty axioms were created and owl:equivalentClass and owl:disjointWith axioms were defined (if exist).


Example 3
Question: A new owl:ObjectProperty must be inserted. How will this be implemented?
Thought 1: I need to check if this owl:ObjectProperty is already modelled in the current version of the ontology. 
Action 1: Check if this owl:ObjectProperty already exist in the ontology. 
Observation 1: The given owl:ObjectProperty does not exist in the current version of the ontology. 
Thought 2: It should be investigated the rdfs:domain and rdfs:range of owl:ObjectProperty
Action 2: Investigate possible rdfs:domain and rdfs:range for the owl:ObjectProperty.
Observation 2: There are possible owl:Class for rdfs:domain and rdfs:range for the given owl:ObjectProperty.
Thought 3: So, the owl:ObjectProperty should be inserted into the ontology.
Action 3: Insert the owl:ObjectProperty into the ontology and define rdfs:domain and rdfs:range.
Observation 3: The new owl:ObjectProperty was inserted.
Thought 4: It should be investigated if owl:equivalentProperty exist.  
Action 4: Investigate possible existence of owl:equivalentProperty.
Observation 4: There are owl:ObjectProperty that are owl:equivalentProperty with the new owl:ObjectProperty.
Thought 5: It should be investigated if owl:inverseOf exist.  
Action 5: Investigate possible existence of owl:inverseOf.
Observation 5: There is owl:ObjectProperty that is owl:inverseOf of the new owl:ObjectProperty.
Thought 6: It should be investigated if owl:TransitiveProperty exist.  
Action 6: Investigate possible existence of owl:TransitiveProperty.
Observation 6: There is owl:ObjectProperty that is owl:TransitiveProperty with the new owl:ObjectProperty.
Thought 7: It should be investigated if an owl:SymmetricProperty exists.  
Action 7: Investigate possible existence of an owl:SymmetricProperty.
Observation 7: There is owl:ObjectProperty that is owl:SymmetricProperty with the new owl:ObjectProperty.
Thought 9: So, any owl:equivalentProperty, owl:inverseOf, owl:TransitiveProperty, and owl:SymmetricProperty axioms should be defined. 
Action 9: Define the owl:equivalentProperty, owl:inverseOf, owl:TransitiveProperty, and owl:SymmetricProperty axioms.
Observation 9: The axioms were inserted successfully.
Response: A new owl:ObjectProperty was successfully inserted into the ontology. 


Example 4
Question: A new owl:DatatypeProperty must be inserted. How will this be implemented?
Thought 1: I need to check if this new owl:DatatypeProperty already exists in the current version of the ontology. 
Action 1: Check if this owl:DatatypeProperty already exist in the ontology. 
Observation 1: The given owl:DatatypeProperty does not exist in the current version of the ontology. 
Thought 2: It should be investigated the rdfs:domain and rdfs:range of the new owl:DatatypeProperty
Action 2: Investigate possible rdfs:domain and rdfs:range for the new owl:DatatypeProperty
Observation 2: There are possible concepts for rdfs:domain and rdfs:range for the new owl:DatatypeProperty
Thought 3: So, the owl:DatatypeProperty should be inserted into the ontology.
Action 3: Insert the owl:DatatypeProperty into the ontology and define rdfs:domain and rdfs:range.
Observation 3: The new owl:DatatypeProperty was inserted. 
Thought 4: It should be investigated if a rdfs:subPropertyOf exists.  
Action 4: Investigate possible existence of rdfs:subPropertyOf.
Observation 4: There is an owl:DatatypeProperty that is rdfs:subPropertyOf of the new owl:DatatypeProperty.
Thought 5: So, the rdfs:subPropertyOf axiom should be defined. 
Action 5: Define the trdfs:subPropertyOf axioms. 
Observation 5: The axioms were inserted successfully.
Response: A new owl:DatatypeProperty and the related axioms were successfully inserted into the ontology.
