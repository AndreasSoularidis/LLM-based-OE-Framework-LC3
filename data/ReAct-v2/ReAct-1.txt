Question: How should a new ontology be created to meet the given aim and scope?

Thought 1: To avoid duplicating existing knowledge, I should first check if there are established ontologies relevant to this domain.

Action 1: Search the web for ontologies related to this domain.

Observation 1: I have found several related ontologies in this area.

Thought 2: To keep the ontology focused and practical, I should only consider the most widely used and currently maintained (live) ontologies.

Action 2: Review the list of existing ontologies and select only those that are widely used and currently maintained.

Observation 2: I now have a refined list of widely used, live ontologies for reference.

Thought 3: Next, I need the IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) of these selected ontologies to integrate them effectively.

Action 3: Perform a web search to locate the IRIs of the selected ontologies.

Observation 3: I have obtained the IRIs of the relevant ontologies, which are ready for integration.

Response: I will proceed by reusing these widely adopted, live ontologies in the new ontology, using their respective IRIs and prefixes to ensure compatibility and reusability.
